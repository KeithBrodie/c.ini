{"name":"C.ini","tagline":"Parameterized C language configuration file package. Generates INI file template, C structure, and file parsing code from a single parameter definition file.","body":"### Welcome to C.ini.\r\nC.ini defines a configuration or ini file format, C structure, and parse code from a single parameter definition file by abusing the C preprocessor with multiply re-defined macro definitions.  Add or modify a parameter with one file edit and a make.  The 'struct' is redefined, parse code for reading the parameters in any order is generated, and a input file template is optionally created when the parse code is called.  C.ini makes handling configuration parameters simple and fast in your C/c++ projects.\r\n\r\n### INI file format\r\nThe INI file format is somewhat like a Fortran namelist file.  Comment lines are officially indicated with a # or % - but in fact any line can be a comment since the parser ignores lines which lack an \"=\" sign or a recognized parameter to the left of the \"=\" sign.  Repeated whitespace on the line is ignored, and parameter names must be legal 'C' field names.\r\n\r\n### parameter.definition\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
